# UltimateInventory Client Mod

Client-side mod for the UltimateInventory plugin. When you pick a block (middle-click by default) and vanilla Minecraft fails to find it in your inventory, this mod sends a request to the server plugin which searches your shulker boxes and places the item in your hotbar.

## Features

- Automatically detects when you pick a block and vanilla pick block fails
- Sends requests to the UltimateInventory plugin to search shulker boxes
- Works in survival and creative modes
- Works with any block - no configuration needed
- Completely seamless - vanilla pick block behavior is preserved

## Requirements

### Runtime Requirements

- Minecraft 1.21.5
- Fabric Loader 0.16.9+
- Fabric API (recommended)
- [UltimateInventory plugin](https://github.com/MaxAdams98/UltimateInventory) on the server

### Development Requirements

- **Java 21+** (JDK 21 or higher)
- **Gradle** (included via Gradle Wrapper - `./gradlew`)
- **Litematica** (optional, for Mixin development - place `litematica-fabric-*.jar` in `libs/` folder)

## Installation

1. Install Fabric Loader for Minecraft 1.21.5
2. Install Fabric API (optional but recommended)
3. Place this mod in your `.minecraft/mods/` folder
4. Connect to a server with UltimateInventory plugin installed

## How It Works

1. When you **pick a block** (middle-click by default), vanilla Minecraft's pick block function applies first
2. If vanilla fails to find the item in your inventory, this mod kicks in and sends a request to the UltimateInventory plugin
3. The plugin searches your shulker boxes for the picked block
4. If found, the plugin places the item in your hotbar, swapping with the previous item in that slot if it wasn't empty
5. Tools and shulker boxes cannot be moved/swapped by design to protect your inventory

**Note:** Normal pick block still works exactly as before. The mod only activates when vanilla pick block fails to find the item in your inventory.

## Development

### Building from Source

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MaxAdams98/UltimateInventory.git
   cd UltimateInventory/UILitematicaShulkerPick
   ```

2. Build the mod:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew clean build
   ```

3. The compiled JAR will be in `build/libs/ultimate-inventory-shulker-pick-{version}.jar`

4. Copy the JAR to your `.minecraft/mods/` folder

### Development Setup

1. **Litematica (Optional):** If you want to develop/test the Litematica integration:
   - Download or build Litematica for Minecraft 1.21.5
   - Place `litematica-fabric-*.jar` in the `libs/` folder
   - The build script will automatically find and use it

2. **IDE Setup:**
   - Import the project as a Gradle project
   - Your IDE should automatically detect the Gradle Wrapper
   - Ensure your IDE is using Java 21

3. **Running in Development:**
   - Use the Fabric development environment
   - Run `./gradlew runClient` (if configured) or use your IDE's run configuration

## Building Releases

This project includes a release build script that automatically:
- Increments the version number
- Builds the mod
- Places the JAR in the `releases/` folder
- Removes old releases for the same version

### Using the Script

```bash
# Patch version (default): 1.0.0 -> 1.0.1
./build-release.sh
# or
./build-release.sh patch

# Minor version: 1.0.0 -> 1.1.0
./build-release.sh minor

# Major version: 1.0.0 -> 2.0.0
./build-release.sh major
```

### Using Gradle Tasks (Alternative)

You can also trigger the release script via Gradle:

```bash
# Patch version increment (default)
./gradlew release

# Minor version increment
./gradlew releaseMinor

# Major version increment
./gradlew releaseMajor
```

The release JARs are placed in the `releases/` directory with the naming convention:
`ultimate-inventory-shulker-pick-{minecraft_version}-{mod_version}.jar`
